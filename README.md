Demonstration of Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection.

# Getting Started

Clone, run `flutter pub get`, and then run `flutter pub run build_runner build`

Don't worry, be happy.

# Scope

This project should demonstrate different approaches to dependency calls. The main funcionality of the app is to get an User from the database, change its name and save it to the database. The difference will come from the approach that's going to be used. There are 3 folders with examples 1 to 3, each with a different approach to IoC and DI.

## Example 1

This example is made to demonstrate the worst case scenario, without IoC at all and bad practices.

## Example 2

This example is a better approach with IoC, but without DI. It's already a testable solution that's a bit scalable.

## Example 3

This is the perfect example, using IoC and DI with property injection, and is the way to go.
